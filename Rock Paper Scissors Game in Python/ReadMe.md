#Introduction
Hello folks! Today, we are back with a fantastic tutorial on the Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python. 
We all are familiar with the topic that we have chosen for todayâ€™s tutorial. 
We all played this game with our friends during our childhood time. 
Basically, we used to use our hand gestures in order to show the shapes of rock, paper, and scissors. 
On the other hand, there will be another player who will go on with the same gestures. 
We usually used to play this game thrice and then decide the winner accordingly.
Imagine building this in Python; you will have a game to play whenever you are bored. 
So let us start our article and make this project.
We will start with getting an overview and then talk about a complete code explanation.
Now, let us move on to getting an idea for the Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python.
#Implementation
Basic Idea
Here, we will convert this hand gesture-based game into a game that can be played with a computer. All game rules will be the same as they will be, but we will keep track of the scores of both players in digital format. Let us check the list of superiority among the three objects in the Rock, Paper, and Scissor Game in Python.

Rock < Paper
Paper < Scissor
Scissor < Rock
Features of Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python
Below are some of the features that we need to have in our Rock Paper and Scissor Game

Display 3 options for the user to choose from, namely, Rock, Paper, and Scissors
Display live score counter of user and PC
